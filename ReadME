Hello,
This is my first console aplication in c#. So if you reading this, please forgive me my mistakes:)
If you have some reservation about my code, please write your proposition in Issues .

This program is a simply calculator which is immune to entering data incorrectly:
-adding more than one symbol of action (+,-,*,/)
-adding only one number
-starting or ending equation by symbol
-adding letter
